  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract = {Road surface markings, like symbols and line markings, are vital traffic infrastructures for driving safety and efficiency. However, real-world conditions can impair the utility of existing road markings. For example, adverse weather conditions such as snow and rain can quickly obliterate visibility.We propose a novel MagnETic ROad marking system (METRO) for robust recognition of road markings at low cost and high deployability. METRO pairs (a) easily deployable passive magnetic road markings with (b) an automotive-grade magnetic sensing framework that detects and interprets these markings. The design of METRO addresses several real-world challenges, such as mitigating the impact of magnetic disturbances, lowering deployment costs, and enhancing the durability of magnetic tags. On-road field tests of METRO demonstrate an overall accuracy of over 96\% in interpreting various road markings in adverse conditions with less cost (only $0.17 per meter) than traditional road markings ($0.21--7.70 per meter). Our field evaluation of METRO over one month demonstrates the practicality and robustness of METRO in real-world settings. Specifically, we observed no performance degradation in the METRO sensor array and no damage or demagnetization to METRO's magnetic tags.},

abstract = {Fiducial marking is indispensable in mobile robots, including their pose calibration, contextual perception, and navigation. However, existing fiducial markers rely solely on vision-based perception which suffers such limitations as occlusion, energy overhead, and privacy leakage.We present Polaris, the first vision-free fiducial marking system, based on a novel, full-stack magnetic sensing design. Polaris can achieve reliable and accurate pose estimation and contextual perception, even in NLOS scenarios. Its core design includes: (1) a novel digital modulation scheme, Magnetic Orientation-shift Keying (MOSK) that can encode key information like waypoints and coordinates with passive magnets; (2) a robust and lightweight magnetic sensing framework to decode and localize the magnetic tags. Our design also equips Polaris with three key features: sufficient encoding capacity, robust detection accuracy, and low energy consumption. We have built an end-to-end system of Polaris and tested it extensively in real-world scenarios. The testing results have shown Polaris to achieve an accuracy of up to 0.58 mm and 1° in posture estimation with a power consumption of only 25.08 mW.},

abstract = {Magnetic sensing is a promising approach for enabling high-accuracy and fine-grained tracking. Recent research has highlighted the superior performance of magnetic tracking in various subtle motion sensing tasks, such as hand and joint tracking. These tasks typically rely on computational resources available on laptops. However, the feasibility of migrating magnetic tracking techniques to mobile platforms, such as smartphones with limited computing power and energy capabilities, remains uncertain. This demo demonstrates the successful deployment of magnetic tracking techniques on commodity smartphones. Our implementation is benchmarked on a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Android smartphone. Empirical studies indicate that our implementation on mobile platforms is both energy-efficient and highly effective.},
