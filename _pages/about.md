I'm currently a fourth-year PhD student in [IIOT Research Center](https://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/#/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Dongyao Chen](https://chendy.tech/) of CyPhy Lab. 
Previously, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2021. 

My research interests focus on Internet of Things (IoT), wireless sensing system and robotic system.
Currently, I am focusing on magnetic sensing techniques for perception and detection tasks in complex environments.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
