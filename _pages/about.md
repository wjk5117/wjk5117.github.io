I'm currently a fourth-year PhD student in [IIOT Research Center](https://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/#/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Dongyao Chen](https://chendy.tech/) of CyPhy Lab. 
Previously, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2021. 

My research lies at the intersection of wireless sensing, embedded intelligence, and mobile robotics. I focus on building robust, energy-efficient sensing systems that enable high-precision perception in resource-constrained and complex environments.
Currently, I am particularly interested in magnetic sensing, a modality that is naturally immune to occlusion, lighting conditions, and wireless interferenceâ€”making it uniquely suited for challenging, real-world scenarios.
To explore its potential, I developed Polaris, a vision-free magnetic fiducial system for mm-level robot pose estimation, and METRO, a magnetic road infrastructure system enabling all-weather road marking perception for vehicles.
